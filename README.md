This is a 4th Semester Web Technology Project in my course Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (B. Sc.). The task is as follows:
- Develope a local website which allows user to manage a list of weather stations and display the current and pass weather measurement data using Model-View-Controller.
- Integrate the page to display data from a database using PostgreSQL.
- Visualize the data from OpenWeather API to be displayed on the website.
